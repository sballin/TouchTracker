# Lokey iOS

A weird keyboard.

## Status

Absolute shit at guessing. Need more precise dictionary because xs aren't helping with lookup.

## Easy tasks

- Make plist format dictionaries using Python
- Use NSSets in snakeDictionary instead of NSMutableArrays to do intersection stuff and maybe speedup

## Long-term tasks

- Accuracy
- Short words
- Combined score
    - Touch data interpretation
    - Frequency
- Pressing space

## Resources

- [Gutenberg frequency lists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists#Project_Gutenberg)

## Cleanup

- Get rid of snakePathOfWord method
